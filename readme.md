# Eigen C++ Library: A Practical Learning Guide

This document serves as a summary of the core concepts, tricks, and best practices for using the Eigen C++ linear algebra library. The code in this project is organized by topic, demonstrating each concept in a separate, runnable file.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple `.cpp` files, one for each topic. The `main.cpp` file acts as a driver that can execute the code for a specific topic by changing a single variable.

```cpp
// In main.cpp
#include "topic1_basics.cpp"
#include "topic2_arithmetic.cpp"
// ...and so on for all topics

int main() {
    // Change this value to run the code for the corresponding topic
    const int topic_to_run = 12;

    switch (topic_to_run) {
        case 1: run_topic1(); break;
        // ...
    }
}
```

To compile, use CMake with the provided `CMakeLists.txt`. Since `main.cpp` includes all other source files, it is the only file that needs to be listed as an executable source.

### Topic 1: Core Building Blocks

- **`Eigen::Matrix`**: The central class. `Matrix<Scalar, Rows, Cols>`.
- **`Eigen::Vector`**: A special case of `Matrix` with 1 column.
- **Fixed-size vs. Dynamic-size**:
    - **Fixed-size**: `Matrix3f`, `Vector4d`. Use for small matrices (\<= 4x4) for maximum performance (stack allocation).
    - **Dynamic-size**: `MatrixXd`, `VectorXf`. Use `Eigen::Dynamic` for dimensions determined at runtime.
- **Initialization**: Use the comma-initializer `<<` for clean setup. Special initializers include `::Zero()`, `::Ones()`, `::Identity()`, and `::Random()`.

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
Eigen::Matrix3f m;
m << 1, 2, 3,
     4, 5, 6,
     7, 8, 9;
```

### Topic 2: Matrix and Vector Arithmetic

- **Standard Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` work as expected for matrix-scalar and matrix-matrix operations.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: `*` is linear algebra matrix multiplication. Inner dimensions must match.
- **Coefficient-Wise Operations**: To perform element-by-element operations, use the `.array()` method.
    - `cwise_product = a.array() * b.array();`
    - `m = m.array().sqrt();`
    - `m = m.array() + 5;`

### Topic 3: Reductions, Visitors, and Norms

- **Reductions**: Operations that return a single scalar from a matrix.
    - `sum()`, `prod()`, `mean()`, `trace()`.
    - `minCoeff()`, `maxCoeff()`.
- **Visitors**: Find the location of a min/max value by passing pointers as arguments: `mat.maxCoeff(&row, &col);`.
- **Norms**:
    - `.norm()`: Euclidean (L2) norm. Involves a square root.
    - **Best Practice**: Use `.squaredNorm()` for comparisons, as it avoids the expensive square root and gives the same result.

### Topic 4: Partial Access and Block Operations

- **Accessing Parts**: Eigen provides highly-optimized methods to access parts of matrices/vectors.
    - **Vectors**: `.head(n)`, `.tail(n)`, `.segment(start, size)`.
    - **Matrices**: `.row(i)`, `.col(j)`.
    - **Blocks**: `.block(startRow, startCol, numRows, numCols)`. Use the template version `.block<H,W>(r,c)` for fixed-size blocks.
- **Writable Views (l-values)**: All block expressions are "l-values," meaning you can assign to them.
  `matrix.block(0,0,2,2) = Matrix2f::Zero();`

### Topic 5: Solving Dense Linear Systems

- **The Problem**: Solve `Ax = b` for `x`.
- **Best Practice**: **Never** use `x = A.inverse() * b;`. It is slow and numerically unstable.
- **The Right Way**: Use a matrix decomposition. Eigen chooses the best algorithm for you.
    - `.lu()`: For general square matrices.
    - `.ldlt()`: For symmetric positive definite matrices (fastest).
    - `.colPivHouseholderQr()`: General purpose, robust solver for any matrix (including rectangular least-squares).

<!-- end list -->

```cpp
// Robustly solve Ax = b
Eigen::Vector3f x = A.lu().solve(b);
```

### Topic 6: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- **The Problem**: Solve `Av = λv` for eigenvalue `λ` and eigenvector `v`.
- **`EigenSolver`**: The general-purpose solver for any square matrix.
    - **Important**: Returns complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as they can be complex for non-symmetric matrices.
- **`SelfAdjointEigenSolver`**:
    - **Best Practice**: **Always** use this for symmetric matrices. It's much faster and guarantees real-valued results.

### Topic 7: Geometry and Transformations

- **Header**: `#include <Eigen/Geometry>`
- **Rotations**:
    - `AngleAxis`: Intuitive way to create a rotation (`angle`, `axis`).
    - `Quaternion`: Best for storage, composition, and interpolation (avoids gimbal lock).
    - `RotationMatrix` (`Matrix3f`): Best for transforming vectors.
- **Transformations**: `Eigen::Affine3f` represents a full 4x4 transformation matrix (rotation, translation, scaling).
    - Build by composing operations: `T * R * S` (applied right-to-left).
    - Apply to points: `transformed_p = T * p;`

### Topic 8: Interfacing with Raw Buffers (Eigen::Map)

- **`Eigen::Map`**: A lightweight "view" that wraps a raw C-style array or `std::vector`'s data without copying it.
- **Efficiency**: Operations on a `Map` directly modify the original data buffer.
- **Usage**: `Eigen::Map<MatrixType> my_map(pointer_to_data, rows, cols);`
- **Const-Correctness**: Use `Eigen::Map<const MatrixType>` for read-only access.

### Topic 9: The Aliasing Problem

- **Aliasing**: Occurs when the same variable appears on the source and destination of an assignment in a way that can corrupt the result (e.g., `mat = mat.transpose();`).
- **Solutions**:
    - **In-place methods**: `mat.transposeInPlace();` (only for square matrices).
    - **`.eval()`**: The general solution. It forces the complete evaluation of the right-hand side into a temporary variable before assignment. `mat = mat.transpose().eval();`.

### Topic 10: Partial Reductions and Broadcasting

- **Partial Reductions**: Apply an operation to each column or row.
    - `.colwise()`: Operates on each column, returns a row vector (e.g., `mat.colwise().sum()`).
    - `.rowwise()`: Operates on each row, returns a column vector (e.g., `mat.rowwise().mean()`).
- **Broadcasting**: Applies an operation between a matrix and a vector.
    - `matrix.colwise() += column_vector;`
    - `matrix.array().rowwise() *= row_vector.array();`

### Topic 11: File I/O

- **Simple Method**: Use standard C++ `fstream` with the `<<` operator for human-readable text output. `file << matrix;`. The `>>` operator can read data back, but the destination matrix must be pre-sized correctly.
- **Robust Method**: To read a file with unknown dimensions:
    1.  Read the file line-by-line (`std::getline`).
    2.  Use `std::stringstream` to parse numbers from each line.
    3.  Store all numbers sequentially in a `std::vector<double>`.
    4.  Keep track of row and column counts.
    5.  Use `Eigen::Map` to wrap the `std::vector`'s data into a final `Eigen::Matrix`.

### Topic 12: Sparse Matrices

- **Purpose**: For matrices where most elements are zero. Saves enormous amounts of memory and computation time.
- **Header**: `#include <Eigen/Sparse>`
- **Best Practice for Creation**: Use the **triplet list** method for efficiency.
    1.  Create a `std::vector<Eigen::Triplet<double>>`.
    2.  Populate the vector with `(row, col, value)` for each non-zero element.
    3.  Call `sparse_mat.setFromTriplets(...)` to build the matrix.
- **Sparse Solvers**: You must use dedicated sparse solvers.
    - `SimplicialLDLT`: For symmetric positive definite systems.
    - `SparseLU`: For general square systems.
    - `ConjugateGradient`, `BiCGSTAB`: Iterative solvers for very large systems.
